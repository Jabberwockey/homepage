*Spoilers ahead. Like, lots of spoilers. You have been warned.*

In one of the most climactic scenes of the show Devs, the protagonist
Lily sits across from Katie, one of the two antagonists while the two
discuss which is essentially the central premise of the whole
show. The mystery of what the "Devs" team at the tech company "Amaya"
is really doing, the mystery that got Lily's boyfriend killed in the
first episode.

For dramatic purposes Katie says that the only way to explain this is
by a style of Socractic back-and-forth and reluctantly our heroine
gives in, although it is actually fairly easy to do this without a
patronising aural exam.

The premise is this: thanks to a highly advanced quantum computer, the
Devs team devised a system which can calculate and then simulate on
screen everything that has ever happened - and everything that ever
will happen. It is a complete simulation of the world. You want to
watch the crucifixion of Jesus Christ? Just punch in the date and the
geographic coordinates. You want to see Marilyn Monroe having sex in
her private bedroom? Get some popcorn. You want to see whether the bad
guy is following you and waits around the corner? Here you go.

The show is quick to note that this is only possible because we live
in a deterministic world. Take a queue and hit a ball on a pool table
and the way the ball rolls and interacts with the other balls is a
matter of simple physics. Knowing all these formulas you can just
calculate everything.

So Katie asks a very important question: "Does anything ever happen
without a reason?" Lily answers "Random events." but fails to convince
Katie by the examples she's giving.

That is disappointing. Lily is supposed to be a cryptography expert in
the show. And not any cryptography expert, one who is on the payroll
of a major tech company.

At the heart of most cryptographic algorithms are numbers which are

1. prime
2. random

So the existence of things which are truly random is at the very heart
of Lily's field of expertise. Of course a random number and a random
event aren't necessarily the same, unless you realise that the event
"I win a huge amount of money at the Casino" and the random number
produced by some dice are linked.

But for the sake of the question: radioactive material emits radiation
because of a process of atomic decay. But the precise moment of the
decay of a single nucleus is completely random and cannot be
calculated.

In fact, rigging a Geiger counter to count the milliseconds between
radioactive particles being detected is one way to construct a true
random number generator.

If you are reading this as a Devs fan, you may not be convinced, as
the show claims that this argument is too easy. Ok, maybe YOU don't
know exactly when the nucleus breaks down, but maybe you just lack the
information necessary to calculate it. Maybe you just need to learn
more about quarks and come up with some other formulas and then you
have the necessary tools to have a complete simulation and what may
look random to you now is infact completely deterministic and, what's
more, predetermined.

And that would be a fairly convincing argument - if this was the 19th
century. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a mathematician who lived around
the turn of the 17th to the 18th century, dreamed of exactly something
like that. He dreamed that all you need is to gather all the formulas,
all the natural laws of nature and then you can construct a machine
that gives you all the answers. Whether there is a god or whether
there's free will would be just a matter of turning the right dials.

Unfortunately for Leibniz and the show, we learned that this is
impossible in the 20th century.

# Incompleteness

Basically the idea of the show is: we only need complete knowledge
about the world and then we can simulate the world completely.
