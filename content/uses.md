The idea of a Uses page is to tell you about the stuff I use.

Make sure to check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) for a list of everyone's Uses pages!

I often get asked about what software or hardware I use, so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious readers to when I get asked.

## Editor + Terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is one of my current editors
- Chrome is my main browser

## Desktop Apps
