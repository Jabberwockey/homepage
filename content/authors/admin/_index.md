#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, #using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Software developer, writer, trainer

I'm employed as a software architect at Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe AG. Looking back on a long career as a software developer starting 1997, I've also conducted many successful training programmes to teach other developers in many different skills, including:
- Java and associated technologies like Jakarta EE, Spring Boot, Maven, Gradle, etc.
- Python and associated technologies
- General software development and algorithms
